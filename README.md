* **Secure Authentication:** Utilizes industry-standard password hashing and token-based authentication.
* **Personalized Profile Management:** Users can view and update their profiles.
* **Responsive Design:** Adapts flawlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
* **Backend Integration:** Integrates seamlessly with a backend server for data storage and management.

**Getting Started:**

    * Basic knowledge of React JSX, components, and state management.
    * Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
2. **Project Setup:**
    * Clone or download this repository.
    * Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install dependencies.
3. **Configuration:**
    * Follow instructions in the `config.js` file to set up your backend API endpoint and environment variables.
4. **Run the Application:**
    * Run `npm start` (or `yarn start`) to start the development server.
    * Access the app in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:3000`).

**Usage:**
* **Login:** Enter credentials in the login form. Upon successful authentication, you'll be redirected to your profile page.
